Sarah had a women's bible study tonight, which meant I was home alone with the kids.

We had a good time. The first order of business, to keep the house in relative order for the night, was to clean up after dinner. After the table was clear, the food put away, and a round of potty breaks for everyone, we got to the main order of the night, the playground.

My kids amaze me. This little playground was attached to a small elementary school, and at this time in the evening it was completely deserted. In no time they took to the slides. We had been there once before, so they weren't really exploring this time, they were seeking adventure.

My boy knows how to go down a slide.
