# What is the Dayton Labs Testbed?

One thing I want to learn how to do is maintain a website. This is that website. It is little more than a place I store things.

I hope you'll find plenty of things here. I plan on posting about tricks I've learned at work that I want to remember, somebody has to tell the future me how to do things. I have a family I care deeply about, I hope this website can be a place I can talk about what I'm learning as a husband and a father. I also have dreams of explaining useful things I've learned in my career, things fellow students of physics might find helpful. Who really knows what will go here.
